## Complete CI/CD Cycle (CI/CD/Dockers)
- [x] Containerizing with Docker
- [x] exposing the model with a flask api
- [x] using Githup actions
- [ ] using kupernates

### Data pipelines (Airflow)
- [x] setup airflow
- [x] working wth train model
- [x] understanding triggers
- [ ] using airflow with docker operators to trigger (using 2 DAGs) training and inference of the model 

### Kupernates
- [x] setup Kupernates
- [/] using the model in kupernates

### Security

* [ ] **Encrypt the model** before saving and securely decrypt it during deployment.
* [ ] **Deploy the model** via a Flask API with  **JWT authentication** .
* [ ] Protect the model against adversarial attacks by applying  **adversarial training** .
* [ ] **Monitor the deployment** using logging.
