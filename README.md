### Security

* [ ] **Encrypt the model** before saving and securely decrypt it during deployment.
* [ ] **Deploy the model** via a Flask API with  **JWT authentication** .
* [ ] Protect the model against adversarial attacks by applying  **adversarial training** .
* [ ] **Monitor the deployment** using logging.
